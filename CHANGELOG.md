# Changelog

All notable changes to `ResponseResultHandler` and `ResponseResultHandler.AspNetCore` are documented
here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project does not
yet commit to strict [SemVer](https://semver.org/) pre-1.0-style guarantees, but breaking changes are
always called out explicitly below.

## [12.0.0]

### Added
- `Result.Combine(params IOperationResult[])` / `Result.Combine(IEnumerable<IOperationResult>)`
  (`ResultHandler.Facade`) — merges independent checks into one outcome, collecting *every* failing
  result's messages instead of stopping at the first (see README §8).
- `Result.Combine<T1, T2>` / `<T1, T2, T3>` / `<T1, T2, T3, T4>` overloads — same merge behavior as
  above, but for `IOperationResult<T>`s: on success, returns every payload as a named tuple.
- `ResultExtensions.Ensure<T>` / `EnsureAsync<T>` (`ResultHandler.Functional`) — guard-clause-style
  helper that turns an already-successful result into a failure when a business-rule predicate
  rejects the data (see README §7).
- Async composition: `MatchAsync`, `OnSuccessAsync`, `OnFailureAsync`, `MapAsync`, `BindAsync`
  (`ResultHandler.Functional`) — `Task`-aware counterparts of the sync composition helpers, each in
  the three shapes needed to chain across `await` without an intermediate one (see README §9).

### Changed
- Enforced `StyleCop.Analyzers` and `SonarAnalyzer.CSharp` across all three projects; the codebase
  builds warning-free under both. Suppressed rules are limited to ones that conflict with an existing,
  deliberate convention (documented per-rule in `.editorconfig`) — nothing is silenced to hide a real
  issue.
- Centralized previously-duplicated literals (`"Operation completed successfully."`,
  `"An error occurred."`, `"Validation Failed"`, and the 3xx redirect message templates) behind single
  named constants (`OperationResultDefaults`, `ResultTitles`) so the concrete/generic overload pairs
  and legacy constructors can never drift apart.

### Removed (breaking)
- `StatusMessage`, `StatusCode: HttpStatusCode`, and `ResultData` — the members deprecated in
  `[11.0.0]` are gone, no forwarding shim. Use `Title`, `Status: ResultStatus`, and `Data`.
- Every `HttpStatusCode`-based constructor on `OperationResult`, `OperationDataResult<T>`,
  `SuccessResult`, `SuccessDataResult<T>`, `ErrorResult`, and `ErrorDataResult<T>` — use the
  `ResultStatus`-based constructor instead (convert an `HttpStatusCode` via
  `HttpStatusCodeExtensions.ToResultStatus()` if needed). See README §13 "Migrating to v12" for the
  full replacement table.

## [11.0.0]

### Added
- `ResultStatus` enum (`ResultHandler.Core.Enums`) — decouples the library from
  `System.Net.HttpStatusCode`; convert either direction via `HttpStatusCodeExtensions`/`ResultStatusExtensions`.
- `Result` static factory facade (`ResultHandler.Facade`) — one named factory pair per `ResultStatus`.
- RFC 9457 Problem Details support in `ResponseResultHandler.AspNetCore`, including per-status
  `ProblemDetails.Type` URIs and Minimal API `IResult` adapters alongside the existing MVC
  `IActionResult` ones.
- Custom `System.Text.Json` serialization with fixed property names, independent of the consumer's
  `JsonSerializerOptions` naming policy.
- `IResultFailureFactory<TSelf>` / `ResultFailureFactory` (`ResultHandler.Functional`) — lets generic
  infrastructure (MediatR pipeline behaviors, gRPC interceptors) short-circuit without knowing the
  concrete result type.

### Fixed
- `ToActionResult<T>()` / `ToEnvelopedActionResult()` used to hardcode HTTP `200` for any successful
  result carrying a body, discarding the result's actual `Status` (so `Result.Created(...)` came back
  as `200`, not `201`). Both now honor `Status` correctly — see README §13 if you relied on the old
  behavior.

### Deprecated
- `StatusMessage`, `StatusCode: HttpStatusCode`, and `ResultData` — marked `[Obsolete]`, forward into
  the new `Title`/`Status: ResultStatus`/`Data` members, and are kept indefinitely for backward
  compatibility (see README §13).
